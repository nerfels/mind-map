## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Quick Install from npm

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g mind-map-mcp

# Or install locally in your project
npm install mind-map-mcp
```

### Claude Code Integration

#### 1. **Automatic Setup (Recommended)**

The easiest way to set up Mind Map MCP with Claude Code:

```bash
# Run the automatic setup tool
npx mind-map-mcp init-claude-code

# Or if installed globally
mind-map-mcp init-claude-code
```

This automatically:
- ✅ Detects your operating system and Claude installation
- ✅ Creates proper configuration files with correct paths
- ✅ Provides platform-specific setup instructions
- ✅ Includes verification commands and troubleshooting

#### 2. **Manual Setup for Claude Desktop**

If you prefer manual configuration, add this to your Claude Desktop config:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux**: `~/.config/claude-desktop/config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mind-map-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mind-map-mcp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. **Environment Variable Configuration**

You can configure the MCP server to work with specific project directories using the `MCP_PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mind-map-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mind-map-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_PROJECT_ROOT": "/path/to/your/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What it does:**
- Makes MCP scan and cache files in the specified project directory
- Creates `.mindmap-cache` folder in the target project
- Uses project-specific configuration and mind map data
- Allows working with multiple projects independently

**Usage Examples:**
```json
// For a specific project
"env": {
  "MCP_PROJECT_ROOT": "/Users/yourname/projects/my-app"
}

// For a demo or test project
"env": {
  "MCP_PROJECT_ROOT": "/Users/yourname/projects/demo-project"
}
```

**Without this variable:** MCP uses the current working directory where the MCP server was started.

#### 4. **Verify Installation**

After setup, restart Claude and verify the integration:

1. **Check MCP Tools**: In Claude, you should see 33 new MCP tools available
2. **Test Basic Functionality**: Try these commands in Claude:
