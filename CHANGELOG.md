## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-14

### 🧠 Major Features: Brain-Inspired Intelligence (Phase 6)

This release introduces groundbreaking **brain-inspired intelligence** systems based on cutting-edge neuroscience research:

#### ✨ New Brain-Inspired Systems

**🔗 Hebbian Learning System**
- **"Neurons that fire together, wire together"** - Automatic relationship discovery
- Records co-activations between code elements during queries
- Strengthens connections between frequently accessed nodes
- Creates associative memory for improved query relevance
- Automatic pruning of weak connections (synaptic pruning)
- MCP tool: `get_hebbian_stats`

**🎯 Hierarchical Context System**
- Multi-level context awareness: Immediate → Session → Project → Domain
- Dynamic context weighting based on task type
- Context inheritance from higher levels
- Persistent context across sessions
- MCP tool: `get_hierarchical_context_stats`

**👁️ Attention System**
- Dynamic attention allocation based on cognitive load theory
- Multi-modal attention fusion (semantic, structural, temporal, contextual, relational)
- Executive attention for high-priority overrides
- Attention decay and reinforcement learning
- MCP tools: `get_attention_stats`, `allocate_attention`

**⏰ Bi-temporal Knowledge Model**
- Tracks **valid time** (when relationships were true) vs **transaction time** (when discovered)
- Context windows for temporal groupings
- Complete audit trail of knowledge changes
- Automatic relationship invalidation on code changes
- MCP tools: `get_bi_temporal_stats`, `create_context_window`, `query_bi_temporal`

**🔮 Pattern Prediction Engine**
- Anticipates patterns before they fully emerge
- Early warning system for architectural changes
- Proactive code quality improvements
- Time-to-emergence estimation
