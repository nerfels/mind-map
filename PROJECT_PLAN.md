# Mind-Map MCP for Claude Code - Project Plan
**🧠 Brain-Inspired Associative Intelligence for Programming**

## Vision
Create an intelligent Mind-Map Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that transforms how Claude Code understands and interacts with codebases by implementing **associative memory principles** from neuroscience research. Instead of linear text search, use brain-like activation spreading and pattern recognition for more intuitive, human-like code intelligence.

### 🔬 Research Foundation
Based on cutting-edge 2024-2025 research in:
- **Associative Memory Neural Networks** - Pattern storage and retrieval like human brain
- **Temporal Knowledge Graphs** - Time-aware relationship modeling  
- **Neuromorphic Computing** - Intel Loihi 2 & Hala Point (1.15B neurons, 100x energy reduction)
- **Memory-Augmented Networks** - Neural Turing Machines, Differentiable Neural Computers
- **Continual Learning** - Elastic Weight Consolidation, catastrophic forgetting solutions
- **Neural-Symbolic AI** - ACT-R/SOAR cognitive architectures, explainable reasoning
- **Graphiti/Zep Architecture** - Real-time knowledge graph construction

## Core Problems Solved
1. **Linear Thinking**: Traditional AI searches text sequentially vs. human associative patterns
2. **Context Loss**: Claude Code currently explores code blindly each session
3. **No Failure Learning**: Same mistakes repeated, no inhibitory patterns
4. **Static Relationships**: Fixed connections vs. dynamic confidence weighting
5. **Limited Activation**: Single-point queries vs. spreading activation through related concepts
6. **Temporal Ignorance**: No understanding of when relationships were valid vs. discovered
