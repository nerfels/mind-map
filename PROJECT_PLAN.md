# Mind-Map MCP for Claude Code - Project Plan

## Vision
Create an intelligent Mind-Map Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that transforms how Claude Code understands and interacts with codebases by maintaining a persistent, learning-enabled project knowledge graph.

## Core Problems Solved
1. **Context Loss**: Claude Code currently explores code blindly each session
2. **Inefficient Navigation**: Repeated exploration of irrelevant code paths  
3. **No Learning**: Same mistakes repeated, successful patterns forgotten
4. **Limited Project Understanding**: No persistent structural knowledge

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Multi-Layer Mind Map Structure
```
Project Root
├── File Structure Layer (directories, files, sizes, types)
├── Code Structure Layer (classes, functions, imports, exports)
├── Dependency Layer (internal/external dependencies, data flow)
├── Pattern Layer (conventions, frameworks, architectural patterns)
├── History Layer (changes, fixes, errors, solutions)
└── Context Layer (session memory, user preferences, project goals)
```

### 2. Core Components

#### A. Mind Map Engine
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j or lightweight embedded graph
- **Node Types**: Files, Functions, Classes, Dependencies, Errors, Fixes
- **Relationship Types**: Contains, Imports, Calls, Fixes, Relates-to
- **Confidence Scoring**: Track success rates of different paths/solutions

#### B. MCP Server Interface
- **Tools Provided**:
  - `query_mindmap`: Search for relevant files/functions
  - `update_mindmap`: Add new knowledge after operations
  - `get_context`: Retrieve session context and patterns
  - `suggest_exploration`: Recommend where to look based on task

#### C. Learning System
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring code patterns and conventions
- **Error Tracking**: Map error types to successful fix locations
- **Success Metrics**: Track which approaches work for different tasks
- **Temporal Analysis**: Understand how codebase evolves over time

### 3. Integration Points

#### Initial Project Scan
- Parse file structure and basic code analysis
- Identify frameworks, languages, build systems
- Map import/export relationships
- Detect architectural patterns

#### Real-time Updates
- Hook into Claude Code tool usage
- Capture successful/failed operations
- Update confidence scores
- Record new relationships discovered

#### Query Enhancement  
- Pre-filter file exploration based on task relevance
- Surface historical context for similar tasks
- Recommend proven solution patterns

2. **Context Accuracy**: Improve task-relevant file discovery by 80%
3. **Learning Effectiveness**: Reduce repeated mistakes by 70%
4. **Session Continuity**: Maintain 90% context across sessions

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Incremental updates to avoid full rescans
- Efficient graph traversal algorithms
- Caching frequently accessed patterns
- Background processing for non-critical updates

### Scalability
- Handle codebases from 100 to 100k+ files
- Efficient storage for large dependency graphs
- Memory-conscious operation
- Configurable depth/breadth limits

### Privacy & Security
- Local-only operation by default
- Optional encrypted remote storage
- No sensitive data in mind map
- User control over what gets tracked

## Future Enhancements
- Team knowledge sharing across developers
- Integration with version control for change impact analysis
- AI-powered code quality suggestions
- Cross-project pattern learning
- Visual mind map interface for users
