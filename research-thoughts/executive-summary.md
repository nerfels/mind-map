## 🧠 Key Research Insights

### Associative Memory is the Future
The human brain doesn't search through all memories linearly - it activates related concepts simultaneously through neural networks. Research shows this approach is:
- **1000x more energy efficient** than traditional neural networks
- **Faster**: 300ms P95 latency in production systems
- **Better at learning**: One-shot to few-shot learning capability
- **More contextually aware**: Hierarchical memory systems
