## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **MindMapEngine** (`src/core/MindMapEngine.ts`) - Central orchestrator that coordinates all subsystems
   - Implements 33+ MCP tools through service delegation pattern
   - Manages brain-inspired intelligence systems (Hebbian learning, attention, memory)
   - Coordinates multi-language analysis and pattern prediction

2. **Service Layer** (`src/core/services/`)
   - **QueryService** - Handles semantic search, advanced queries, temporal analysis
   - **AnalysisService** - Manages AST parsing, architectural analysis, framework detection
   - **ScanningService** - Project scanning with parallel processing and scalability management
   - **LearningService** - Brain-inspired learning systems (Hebbian, episodic memory, attention)
   - **ConfigurationService** - User preferences, custom patterns, scalability config
   - **DocumentIntelligenceService** - Document analysis and relationship extraction

3. **Handler Pattern** (`src/handlers/`)
   - **QueryHandlers** - MCP tool handlers for query operations
   - **AnalysisHandlers** - MCP tool handlers for code analysis
   - **SystemHandlers** - MCP tool handlers for system operations
   - **ToolingHandlers** - MCP tool handlers for development tooling
   - **FrameworkHandlers** - MCP tool handlers for framework detection
   - **DocumentHandlers** - MCP tool handlers for document intelligence

4. **Brain-Inspired Intelligence Systems**
   - **HebbianLearningSystem** - "Neurons that fire together, wire together" - co-activation learning
   - **InhibitoryLearningSystem** - Failure pattern avoidance and negative learning
   - **AttentionSystem** - Dynamic focus allocation and cognitive load management
   - **EpisodicMemory** - Programming experience storage and retrieval
   - **BiTemporalKnowledgeModel** - Valid vs transaction time tracking
   - **PatternPredictionEngine** - Anticipatory intelligence for emerging patterns

### Data Flow

1. **MCP Server** (`src/index.ts`) receives tool calls from Claude
2. **Handler Classes** validate and delegate to appropriate services
3. **Service Classes** coordinate core components and intelligence systems
4. **Core Components** perform analysis using brain-inspired algorithms
5. **Storage Layer** (`MindMapStorage`) persists graph data and learning state

### Multi-Language Support

The system supports comprehensive AST analysis for 12 programming languages:
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** - Complete AST via TypeScript compiler API
- **Python** - Full AST with framework detection (Django, Flask)
- **Java** - AST parsing with Spring Boot detection
- **Go, Rust, C++** - Struct/interface/function extraction
- **PHP, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, Scala** - Full AST with framework detection

## Key Patterns

### Service Delegation Pattern
The MindMapEngine delegates complex operations to specialized services rather than implementing everything directly. This keeps the main engine focused on coordination.

### Brain-Inspired Intelligence
All learning and analysis systems are based on neuroscience principles:
- **Associative Memory** - Neural activation spreading for relevance
- **Synaptic Strengthening** - Co-activation patterns get reinforced
- **Attention Mechanisms** - Dynamic focus on important code elements
- **Memory Consolidation** - Experience-based learning from success/failure

### Parallel Processing Architecture
Uses worker pools and chunked processing for large projects:
- **ParallelFileProcessor** - Concurrent file analysis
- **ActivationNetwork** - Neuromorphic query processing
- **ScalabilityManager** - Resource usage optimization

## Important Implementation Notes

### File Ignore Patterns
The system has sophisticated ignore pattern support:
- Loads from `.gitignore`, `.mindmapignore`, and custom patterns
- Smart defaults for common build artifacts
- Real-time pattern testing and analytics

### Error Handling
- All MCP tool handlers use `ResponseFormatter` for consistent error responses
- Brain-inspired systems learn from failures through `InhibitoryLearningSystem`
- Comprehensive logging to `.mindmap-cache/mcp.log`

### Performance Considerations
- LRU caching with 100MB memory management
- Multi-index storage for fast graph queries
- Query optimization with execution planning
- Context-aware cache invalidation

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New MCP Tools
1. Define tool schema in `src/tools/index.ts`
2. Add handler method in appropriate handler class
3. Register in the switch statement in `src/index.ts`
4. Implement core logic in relevant service class

### Testing
- Use existing test scripts as templates
- Test both successful and failure scenarios for learning systems
- Verify brain-inspired features (Hebbian learning, attention allocation)
- Test multi-language AST parsing with representative code samples

### Brain-Inspired Features
When modifying learning systems, remember:
- Hebbian learning tracks co-activation patterns
- Inhibitory learning prevents repeated failures
- Attention systems manage cognitive load (Miller's 7¬±2 rule)
- All learning should be persistent across sessions

## How to Use Mind Map MCP for Development Tasks

**IMPORTANT**: Always use Mind Map MCP tools instead of traditional search/grep commands. This project provides 33+ intelligent MCP tools that offer superior code understanding and project intelligence.

### Essential Workflow - Start Every Session

**1. Initialize Project Knowledge**
```
Please scan the project and get initial statistics.
```
This builds the project knowledge graph and enables all brain-inspired features.

**2. Get Project Context**
```
Please get project context and suggest exploration areas for [your current task].
```
Gets intelligent recommendations on where to start.

### Instead of grep/search commands, use:

#### Finding Code Elements
```
# Instead of: grep -r "function_name" .
Please query the mindmap for functions containing "function_name"

# Instead of: find . -name "*.ts" | grep Component
Please query the mindmap for TypeScript files containing "Component"

# Instead of: grep -r "import.*React" .
Please query the mindmap for files that import React
```

#### Understanding Project Structure
```
# Instead of: find . -type f -name "*.ts" | head -20
Please analyze the project architecture and show me the main TypeScript components

# Instead of: ls -la src/
Please query the mindmap for all files in the src directory with their relationships
```

#### Finding Related Code
```

### Best Practices

1. **Always start with project scanning** - This enables all intelligence features
2. **Use Mind Map queries instead of grep/find** - Much more intelligent and context-aware
3. **Update the mind map with task outcomes** - Helps improve future suggestions
4. **Leverage brain-inspired features** - Attention, memory, and pattern prediction
5. **Predict errors before implementing** - Use error prediction for proactive development
6. **Learn from the system's intelligence** - Review Hebbian patterns and attention stats

### Example Complete Development Session

```
# 1. Initialize
Please scan the project and get initial statistics

# 2. Understand current state
Please analyze the project architecture and get insights

# 3. Find relevant code for your task
Please query the mindmap for [your specific need]

# 4. Predict potential issues

```

This approach leverages the full power of the brain-inspired intelligence system instead of basic file system operations.

- Using mind map in novel ways for development

**File Naming Convention:**
- `001-mindmap-as-development-helper.md` (general mind map usage)
- `002-cache-optimization-insights.md` (specific task learnings)
- `003-storage-compression-discoveries.md` (next task)
- etc.

### Best Practices for Mind Map-Assisted Development

1. **Start Every Task with Mind Map Scanning** - `scan_project` and `get_stats`
2. **Query Before Coding** - Understand existing patterns first
3. **Test with Mind Map** - Use mind map queries to validate changes
4. **Document Mind Map Usage** - Record how it helped in learning files
5. **Leverage Brain-Inspired Features** - Use attention, memory, pattern prediction
6. **Update Mind Map with Outcomes** - Feed learnings back into the system

## Storage and Persistence

Data is stored in `.mindmap-cache/` directory:
- `mindmap.json` - Graph database with nodes, edges, and learning state
- `user-config.json` - User preferences and configuration
- `mcp.log` - MCP server operation logs

Learning documentation is stored in `learning/` directory:
- `XXX-[task-name].md` - Sequential learning files documenting mind map usage insights

The system maintains complete audit trails for temporal queries and supports bi-temporal knowledge modeling.
