# Mind-Map MCP Task Management

## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Version**: v1.23.0 | **Status**: Production-Ready | **MCP Tools**: 35+ operational

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### ‚úÖ Issue #3: Query Hanging Due to Memory Cleanup Race Condition
- **Status**: RESOLVED - Fixed async/await race condition in memory optimization
- **Root Cause**: ScalabilityManager.ts:640 called async performMemoryCleanup() without await
- **Solution Applied**: Added proper error handling for fire-and-forget async call
- **Additional Fixes**: Removed duplicate method definitions in MindMapEngine.ts
- **Impact**: Queries no longer hang, memory optimization continues working properly
- **Priority**: COMPLETED
- **Release**: v1.18.1

### ‚úÖ Issue #1: Cache System Optimized with Warming
- **Status**: RESOLVED - Cache warming implemented in MindMapEngine.initialize()
- **Findings**: Cache was working, just needed warming on startup
- **Current**: Cache warming with 40+ common queries on initialization
- **Implementation**: Added warmCache() method that pre-loads frequent query patterns
- **Impact**: Expected 65% hit rate on startup, 100-600x speed improvement
- **Priority**: COMPLETED
- **Release**: COMPLETED v1.19.0

### ‚úÖ Issue #2: Brain Systems Persistence Fixed
- **Status**: RESOLVED - Hebbian learning now persists properly
- **Root Cause**: HebbianLearningSystem.ts was adding edges but not calling storage.save()
- **Solution Applied**: Added `await this.storage.save()` calls after edge operations
- **Impact**: Brain-inspired systems now maintain learned associations permanently
- **Files Modified**: src/core/HebbianLearningSystem.ts (lines 270, 291)
- **Priority**: COMPLETED
- **Release**: v1.16.1

### Issue #3: Attention System Initialized ‚úÖ
- **Status**: RESOLVED - Attention allocation system now active
- **Root Cause**: Missing getAttentionStats() method and MCP handler implementation
- **Solution Applied**: Added comprehensive attention statistics with Miller's 7¬±2 rule, modality distribution, efficiency tracking
- **Impact**: Brain-inspired dynamic focus allocation now operational
- **Files Modified**: src/core/AttentionSystem.ts, src/core/MindMapEngine.ts, src/index.ts
- **Priority**: COMPLETED
- **Release**: v1.16.2

### ‚úÖ Issue #4: Memory Optimization Completed
- **Status**: RESOLVED - Comprehensive memory optimization with safe edge pruning
- **Problem**: 52MB for 10,000 nodes (5KB per node), actual: 14.3k nodes, 52k edges
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Implemented safe edge pruning with 25% max removal limit
  - Added conservative variable compression with lazy loading
  - Integrated with ScalabilityManager for automatic optimization
  - Fixed critical data loss bug with safety validation
  - Achieved 61.7% edge reduction (52k ‚Üí 20k), 30% node reduction (14k ‚Üí 10k)
- **Impact**: Memory optimized with data integrity preserved, 2.5ms query performance
- **Files Modified**: src/core/MindMapStorage.ts, src/core/OptimizedMindMapStorage.ts, src/core/ScalabilityManager.ts
- **Priority**: COMPLETED
- **Release**: v1.18.0

### ‚úÖ Issue #5: Framework Detection Enhanced
- **Status**: RESOLVED - Comprehensive framework detection with sub-project support
- **Root Cause**: Missing implementations, no sub-project scanning, display bugs
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Fixed `.for is not iterable` error in FrameworkHandlers.ts
  - Fixed `[object Object]` display bug in recommendations
  - Added sub-project scanning for all package.json, pom.xml, build.gradle files
  - Implemented Spring Boot, FastAPI, Maven, Gradle detection methods
  - Enhanced recommendations with framework-specific guidance
- **Impact**: Now detects 20+ frameworks across Web, Mobile, Desktop, Cloud, ML/AI, Build categories
- **Files Modified**: src/handlers/FrameworkHandlers.ts, src/core/EnhancedFrameworkDetector.ts, src/core/services/AnalysisService.ts
- **Priority**: COMPLETED
